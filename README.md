Personal website for my blog and advertising projects. Currently under
development.

## Getting Started

Helpful links from GitHub to get going:

- [custom
  domains](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site)

- [managing a
  domain](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site)

Check back on main branch to see if custom domain name is working or not.
A longer tutorial to try is https://github.com/skills/github-pages.

## Jekyll sites

Build site with a Jekyll theme.

- [jekyll
  sites](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll)

- [guides](https://support.github.com/)

Requires installing Ruby and possibly javascript to build and run the sites. A
place for this is in a conda environment

```bash
conda env create -n website
conda activate website
conda install javascript ruby -y
```
