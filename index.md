# About Me

I am a PhD student in Statistics at Texas A&M University, supervised by
Matthias Katzfuss. My interests include spatial statistics, computer surrogate
models, uncertainty quantification, and the statistical aspects of machine
learning.

Prior to joining the department I was a lab manager for the Disease Biophysics
Group in the John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences at
Harvard University. Additional experiences include research in remote sensing
and mapping. I am also a proud veteran of the US Army.
