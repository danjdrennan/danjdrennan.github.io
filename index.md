# About Me

I am a fifth year PhD student in Statistics at Texas A&M University, supervised
by Matthias Katzfuss (University of Wisconsin) and Toryn Schafer (Texas A&M). I
am interested in spatial statistics, emulator models, scientific ML, and
reinforcement learning applied to sequential optimization or behavior modeling.

Previously I was a lab manager in the Disease Biophysics Group in the John A.
Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences at Harvard University. I am a
proud US Army veteran, honorably discharged from the 101st Airborne Division
(Air Assault!). Additional experience includes land surveying and supporting
spatiotemporal vegetation mapping using small unmanned aircraft systems on
Lousiana barrier islands.
