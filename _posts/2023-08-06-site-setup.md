This is a short initial post to understand what new content looks like in a
Jekyll theme. I've set this website up using GitHub pages, a personal domain
from Google domains, and text/file editing in a WSL2 environment on Windows
using vim. Installing Ruby and Jekyll in my environment would enable me to build
and render the site to preview the content, but it is much easier to commit to
main and let the site be built.

Hosting a website on GitHub Pages requires the repo to be open source (unless
you pay to keep it private), and my site is no different. If you're interested
in setting up a site like this one, head over to the
[site repo](https://github.com/danjdrennan/danjdrennan.github.io)
to see the early commit history setting the site up. That won't tell you where
to go to set up a site in the same way, so here are the relevant links

- Register a personal domain using [Google Domains](domains.google.com) for
  $12/year

- Head over to [https://pages.github.com/](https://pages.github.com/) and follow
  their instructions to create your website

- Follow the pages
  [docs](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site)
  to add a Jekyll theme and build a site

If you are going to use a Jekyll site, consider copying and pasting the
structure of my site from the `_config.yml` file, `assets` folder, and
`_layouts` folder. Editing these files while following the docs will get you to
a decent looking site in less than a day.

Cheers.
